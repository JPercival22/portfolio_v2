                                    speech recognition algorithm. The inspiration came from a professional
                                    UX Designer meeting (courtesy of UX Circus Ltd)
                                    concerning advancements in Speech recognition and how including this improves
                                    Accessability and increases User engagement.

                                <p> There are already a number of Guitar Tutorials in the public domain, each with
                                    their own niche. The challenge lies in creating a unique feature that the Users want
                                    to
                                    engage and react with that would improve their engagement and decrease the learning
                                    curve.

                                    methodology with regular feedback stages, ideas were rapidly developed and
                                    validated.

                        <h2>Market Research &amp; Competitive Analysis</h2>
                        <p>I began the design process by conducting research to better understand
                            the online Guitar Tutorials structure and standards. Key features were
                            also compared to see what problems they presented. Personal discoveries were
                            found, that the majority of the tutorials provided sub-standard basic
                            lessons unless one was willing to pay for premium access, the language was aimed more
                            towards
                            advanced students. Further into the research I wanted to see how the public would react to
                            introducing voice command
                            navigation to help ease cognitive overload and reduce the learning curve, by minimising
                            unnecessary
                            movements.
                        </p>
                        <p>An early assumption here, was that the access premium, could be
                            the reason that many beginners, decide not to continue with their learning.</p>
                        <p> Synthesised data from User Interviews confirmed this assumption. </p>

                    <p>
                        Five participants were interviewed (4 Male and 1 Female) over Two phases. The majority were aged
                        between the ages of 18 and 22 years old.
                        Three participants had played guitar for a while and had a lot of experience using online
                        tutorials
                        and two participants had never played a guitar but had always wanted to learn how to.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Research revealed that participants often prefer to interact with internet products, the general
                        consensus was via a mobile device.
                        All participants agreed that having voice navigable feature would certainly make learning
                        easier.
                        Participants who had previous experience with online tutorials, shared their
                        learning journey behaviors, their thoughts and feelings surrounding learning to play the guitar
                        and
                        their experiences with using
                        guitar tutorials, highlighting pain points and elements they thought should have been there for
                        a
                        beginner.
                        All participants confirmed my initial assumption by agreeing the Premium to access the basic of
                        lessons put them off and in most cases caused abandonment.

                        <li>Clear and engaging design: Use visuals that showcase the essence of playing the guitar, such
                            as high-quality images or videos of skilled guitarists. Employ a visually appealing color
                            scheme that catches the user's attention and reflects the energy of playing music.

                            User-friendly navigation: Make sure that the navigation menu is intuitive and easy to use.
                            Categorize the tutorials based on skill level or genre, allowing users to find the content
                            they're interested in quickly and efficiently.

                        <li>
                            Concise and informative headlines: Use descriptive and enticing headlines for each tutorial,
                            clearly stating what users can expect to learn. This helps users identify the content that
                            matches

                        <li>
                            Interactive and engaging elements: Incorporate interactive elements into the landing page,
                            such as playable audio samples or interactive chord diagrams. This allows users to have a
                            hands-on experience and get a feel for the lessons before hand.

                        The reason this library was chosen was because it was the smallest library available,
                        had no AI technology included and was the cut above the rest in
                        relation to responsiveness, speed and adaptation in speech recognition in comparison with the
                        others

                <h3>A/B Testing</h3>
                <p>During this design iterations, the Online Tuner would need to be tested on the User
                    to identify which of the designs would be more useful, simpler to use and have the optimal
                    user
                    flow in
                    terms of conversion rate. <br>
                    Option A, offers additional voice commands separate from the main navigation prompts and
                    specific
                    to this feature. This requires the user to interact with buttons related to a guitar string,
                    which
                    plays a sound bite of the selected strings note once triggered, so that the User can then
                    compare their guitar strings note to then tune their guitar. This is can be achieved by both
                    manual or vocal interaction. <br>
                    These extra steps and voice commands could potentially increase User confusion, learning
                    curve and some
                    frustration. <br>

                    Option B, offers an alternative dynamic. This Tuner utilises the browser accessing the
                    devices microphone,
                    this then analyses the note played by the User and accurately calculates the note. The UI
                    displays this
                    to the user using a chromatic metric. Once the tuner identifies the note is correctly tuned,
                    an identifier
                    signifying this is displayed.<br>
                    This is provided by a 3rd party library, could potentially conflict with the selected
                    library for the Speech
                    Recognition library and cause catastrophe. From a positive perspective, would be much
                    simpler for the User.

                    <h2>Interactive Prototype</h2>
                    <p>To demonstrate the proposed flow, I generated this interactive prototype. It demonstrates how the
                        browser reacts on user interacts vocally with the website. During testing, the user could only
                        navigate
                        vocally using the prompts from the Voice Command hub on the website designs.
                        The test facilitator transferred their commands manually to demonstrate to the
                        user how the browser would react from the users commands.
                    </p>

                        <li>Open the Command Hub using the prompt.</li>
                        <li>Locate the command and dictate to the system that you would like to go to the Basics Lesson
                            1 page.</li>
                        <li>Open the Command Hub again using the method in step 1.</li>
                        <li>Locate the command and dictate that you would like to scroll to the bottom of the page.</li>
                        <li>Using your own intuition from the last command, dictate what you would naturally say, to
                            tell the system, that you would like to scroll to the top of the page.</li>
                        <li>Again, using your intuition, dictate what you would naturally say, to tell the system that
                            you would want to go back to the home page.</li>

                    <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
                    <p>
                        To evaluate the efficiency of this part of the application process, usability tests were
                        conducted
                        on 5 participants using Screen recording together with the Think Aloud protocol to collect the
                        Qualitative data.
                        User feedback was collected via a voluntary survey after the testing was complete to collect the
                        Quantitative data.
                        This data was then Triangulated to answer the overarching aim to measure the feasibility of
                        navigating a website using a
                        non AI Voice Controlled Website. This is the Design phase to warrant the same test on a
                        developed website.
                        These tests were facilitated
                        in confidence and wil never be shared.
                        All users managed to complete the task and could manage to recall the prompts to scroll to the
                        top of the page and return to the home page.
                        One area that 2 out of the 5 participants found of a slight annoyance, was the confirmation
                        modal appearing on each interaction. It was
                        not recorded with the majority of users and therefore did not warrant a removal,
                        although it was minded.

                    <h2>After Thoughts</h2>

                    <p>This UX case study helped me gain a thorough understanding
                        of design, research, testing, and constant iteration processes. I chose to complete this project
                        as a
                        tutorial
                        as I teach guitar and had a solid foundation to begin the project, having had feedback from my
                        students over the
                        years.
                        I wanted to provide all students a free study aid to help them in this area, one that would
                        provide the most use of basic tutorial material
                        that would not cause the Users to remove their guitar from them to turn the page of a book or a
                        website. This would hopefully lower the learning curve by eliminating some of the distractions,
                        of what can be frustrating for most
                        beginners learning to play the guitar.
                    </p>
                    <p>I am glad to learn that even by making
                        small changes, made it possible to yield beneficial impacts and create a great experience for
                        users. It is
                        so important to always validate our assumptions through testing. Designing this way ensures a
                        speedy development and launching of a website or application.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Next Steps</h2>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Develop the free web service.</li>
                        <li>Conduct User Interviews to improve the site prior to launching.</li>
                        <li>Optimise the codebase for an optimal User Experience.</li>
                        <li>If a framework is to be used, constantly review for any changes from the providers.</li>
