                                    speech recognition algorithm. The inspiration came from a UX meet-up
                                    concerning advancements in Speech recognition and how including this improves

                                    engage and react with that would improve their engagement and decrease the learning

                        <p>I began the design process by conducting research to better understand
                            the online Guitar Tutorials structure and standards. Key features were
                            also compared to see what problems they presented. Personal discoveries were
                            found, that the majority of the tutorials provided sub-standard basic
                            lessons unless one was willing to pay for premium access, the language was aimed more
                            towards
                            advanced students. Further into the research I wanted to see how the public would react to
                            introducing voice command
                            navigation to help ease cognitive overload and reduce the learning curve, by minimising

                        high-quality images or videos of skilled guitarists. Employ a visually appealing color scheme
                        that

                        Concise and informative headlines: Use descriptive and enticing headlines for each tutorial,
                        clearly
                        stating what users can expect to learn. This helps users identify the content that matches their

                    <li>
                        Interactive and engaging elements: Incorporate interactive elements into the landing page, such
                        as
                        playable audio samples or interactive chord diagrams. This allows users to have a hands-on

                        tutorials. This could include a checklist or a progress bar that motivates users to continue

                        or practice exercises. Providing extra resources enhances the user's learning journey and makes

                    <p> Tasked with designing and developing a Voice Navigable website to answer the Feasibility of
                        such,
                        understanding that every section had to be data-driven in order to answer it without a margin of
                        error. <br>
                        Results from the Focus Groups formed at the beginning, revealed that there was a need for such a
                        Website and especially in this type of domain.
                        The created online Public Surveys proved fruitful with 106 participant's valued input,
                        improved the design's, produced the keywords for development.
                        The results from the Think Aloud Protocol Tests gave excellent input for Design

                        The Quantitative data from the Surveys and Qualitative Data from the User Interviews
                        were triangulated to reveal if the overarching aim was achieved or not.
                        Project planning was calculated an ETA of 4months to complete, suing the Agile Methodology due
                        to
                        the multiple iterations required during each phase.

                Focus group meeting, consisting of 6 participants, with ages ranging from 18 to 58 years of age, each
                studying
                completely different courses at the University.
                This meeting discovered there was certainly a potential for a trend to develop from this type of
                Website, in
                this type of an educational setting (guitar tutorial).
                There was skepticism involved when the suggestion was made that the project should be a completely stand
                alone,
                voice activated website. It was concluded that it should be a website navigable in the usual way using a
                peripheral
                and voice controlled too.
                It was also revealed that the Tutorial, should act and behave as expected, however, should also be less
                verbose,
                high definition imagery/ videos to be included with a simplistic HCI. <br>
                The data allowed me to paint a clearer picture of what the User's wanted from the product, what they
                expected and more importantly an accurate representation on who wanted the application.
                This information provided me with enough information to build a SWOT Analysis and User personas for
                further research.
            </p>
            <p>
                What followed were efforts to map the existing user experiences to identify other opportunity
                developments:

                <h2>Desk Research</h2>
                <p>A Desk Study study on similar Tutorials available today occurred to identify design patterns and
                    natural
                    User Flow.
                    so that the new site, although unique to the Web Industry, would be familiar to the user too.
                    It was discovered that none of the sites had Voice Control, one had a Guitar Tuner that used the
                    microphone. It was
                    decided at this point not to include this type od Guitar tuner for this site as it could be
                    catastrophic
                    to the
                    reason that this site will use the microphone. This became a recommendation for future research and
                    development though.
                </p>
                The Javascript libraries found that had some capable Speech Recognition suitable for this website were:
                <ul>
                    <li>Artyom.js</li>
                    <li>Anyang.js</li>

                    <li>PocketSphinx.js</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After testing the capabilities of these libraries a decision was made to use Annyang.js;
                    it was the smallest library available, had no AI technology and was the cut above the rest in
                    relation to responsiveness, speed and adaptation in speech recognition in comparison with the others
                    identified.

                            Based on discovery research findings I came up with three hypothesis to ensure successful

                            <li>Simple HCI, utilisiation of the unique use of white space to enhance engagement and stop
                                cognitive overload.</li>
                            <li>A visually pleasing and interactive website should increase Customer Retainability.</li>

                                    page hierarchy that was identical for each site. The sites researched had in excess

                                    30+ pages, it was decided that having so many pages for this site was not required

                    The prototype was developed using HTML5 for the structure, CSS3 to match the design specs, JQuery
                    and
                    Javascript for speech recognition and to enhance the dynamic content.
                    It was tested on 15 users (5 for each of the created persona's), in order to to
                    validate my Hypothesis.
                    User's paralinguistic features were recorded using a web-cam and video recording software at the
                    agreement of the participant, they were tested ethically a new set of participants were brought

                    the test administrator
                    was able to understand how the user's felt about the product whilst also testing the age ranges
                    specified
                    earlier to expand the customer base.

                <h2>First Pass - Designs and Development.</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The early prototypes and User Behaviour proved that both Speech Navigation and the Usual method
                        were
                        required to enhance Usability.</li>
                    <li>Natural Speech Commands were tested vs Dictated Speech Commands. The keywords found during the
                        Survey were found to be sufficient.
                        Although users could access a table of pre-determined commands at any time no navigate
                        successfully,
                        95% of the keywords were guessed when testing.
                    </li>
                    <li>Early designs were shown to have too much text content which delayed the user from efficiently
                        moving through to complete tasks, so as requested more imagery and videos were added and verbose
                        removed.</li>
                    <li>Color Psychology, Emphasis on in page keywords such as, "Well done" or encouraging quotes
                        increased a positive emotion.</li>
                    <li>60% of users found the, in page navigation (index page) on the desktop confusing so redesigning
                        the
                        structure
                        in page
                        navigation (not the top bar) became compulsory.</li>
                    <li> A/B testing on the in page navigation section followed, one was the original design and the
                        other
                        was the restructured design.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Final Pass - Tested Prototype.</h2>
                <p> All Feedback was analysed, errors were caught and designs improved greatly thanks to this.
                    I observed almost entirely positive feedback from the final designs.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Users found the new in page navigation on the index page much easier to follow.</li>
                    <li>Analysis shown that the majority of the users interacted and spent more time using
                        the Speech Navigation as opposed to the usual clickable navigation.</li>
                    <li>All participants were able to complete the task of Vocally navigating from the index page, to
                        the
                        last page and back home.
                        The final test of Vocally navigating from the Home Page, to a page and any part of that page
                        they
                        selected, then returning back to the Home page successfully.
                    </li>
                    <li>During testing it was discovered that 72% of the participants successfully completed the tasks
                        without the
                        need to view the pre-determined command table. Proving the Survey to find natural keywords were
                        a
                        success.
                    </li>
                    <li>99% of the users were not showing signs of confusion or stress whilst completing the test for
                        the
                        final version of each prototype.</li>

                Based on the findings from both the UX research and the Design/ Development validation sessions I was
                able
                to produce
                a list of changes that were addressed and updated in the prototype along with any potential future
                alterations should a revisit to develop the keywords to enhance the Voice Navigation further in the
                future.<br>
                Triangulating the Quantitative data from the Surveys and Qualitative Data from the User Interviews
                during
                and after the Think Aloud Protocol testing, considering that the number of users participating versus
                users
                successfully completing the tasks
                was in the higher percentile - and at a ratio of 5:4 evaluated that the project was a complete success
                and
                answered the overarching aim of Measuring the Feasibility of Navigating A Rich Content Website Vocally
