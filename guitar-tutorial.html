                                    speech recognition algorithm. The inspiration came from a UX meet-up
                                    concerning advancements in Speech recognition and how including this improves
                                    Accessability
                                    and increases User engagement.

                                    to
                                    engage and react with that would improve their engagement and decrease the learning

                        <h2>Market Research &amp; Competitive Analysis</h2>
                        <p>I began the design process by conducting research to better understand
                            the online Guitar Tutorials structure and standards. Key features were
                            also compared to see what problems they presented. Personal discoveries were
                            found, that the majority of the tutorials provided sub-standard basic
                            lessons unless one was willing to pay for premium access, the language was aimed more
                            towards
                            advanced students. Further into the research I wanted to see how the public would react to
                            introducing voice command
                            navigation to help ease cognitive overload and reduce the learning curve, by minimising
                            unnecessary

                        Research revealed that participants often prefer to interact with internet products, the general
                        consensus was via a mobile device.
                        All participants agreed that having voice navigable feature would certainly make learning
                        easier.
                        Participants who had previous experience with online tutorials, shared their
                        learning journey behaviors, their thoughts and feelings surrounding learning to play the guitar
                        and
                        their experiences with using
                        guitar tutorials, highlighting pain points and elements they thought should have been there for
                        a
                        beginner.
                        All participants confirmed my initial assumption by agreeing the Premium to access the basic of
                        lessons put them off and in most cases caused abandonment.

                    Using the research data, I devised a brainstorming session outlining useful key features the site
                    would
                    need
                    to be beneficial. Due to time constraints some where out of scope for the project.
                    <ol>
                        <li>Clear and engaging design: Use visuals that showcase the essence of playing the guitar, such
                            as
                            high-quality images or videos of skilled guitarists. Employ a visually appealing color
                            scheme
                            that
                            catches the user's attention and reflects the energy of playing music.

                            User-friendly navigation: Make sure that the navigation menu is intuitive and easy to use.
                            Categorize the tutorials based on skill level or genre, allowing users to find the content
                            they're
                            interested in quickly and efficiently.

                            clearly
                            stating what users can expect to learn. This helps users identify the content that matches

                            tutorials. This could include a checklist or a progress bar that motivates users to continue
                            learning and provides a sense of achievement. <strong>Out Of Scope</strong> <br>

                            a

                            may
                            access it from their mobile phones or tablets. The content and layout should adapt

                            not

                        The reason this library was chosen was because it was the smallest library available,
                        had no AI technology included and was the cut above the rest in

                    <p>This was my first end-to-end UX design project that allowed me to gain a thorough understanding
                        of design, research, testing, and constant iteration. I chose to do my project on a largely
                        speculative concept in order to challenge myself to think outside of the bounds of existing
                        information. The fact that space travel is high-risk and high-commitment enabled me to delve
                        into the psychology of safety and risk.
                        This project also taught me the complexities of designing novel products that require a large
                        level of commitment. It is only after we take the time to understand the thoughts and feelings
                        of the user that we can effectively support them through these processes

                    <p>Design is never finished, so my next steps would be:

                        Create remaining site pages and application pages
                        Conduct usability testing on users within the target market
                        Explore how to ease safety concerns that arose during usability testing
