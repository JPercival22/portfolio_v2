                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                  SCOUT is part of an intelligence platform, relied upon by analysts and fraud investigators to
                  streamline task-based operations. As part of a broader UI overhaul, I designed a new dashboard
                  experience to act as a control center—surfacing high-priority tasks, providing real-time status
                  updates, and aligning team efforts at a glance.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div class="item">
                <h3>Problem</h3>
                <p>
                  Without a centralized dashboard, users had no easy way to monitor team performance or task
                  progression—leading to inefficiencies, misalignment, and growing frustration. With no dedicated PM or
                  formal roadmap, the design process had to be fast, focused, and tightly attuned to user needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The goal: To deliver a prototype dashboard that would empower users to track KPIs, oversee team
                  workload, and regain clarity over daily operations. This meant understanding core user pain points,
                  identifying essential features, and designing a system that was both intuitive and future-ready.

                <h3>My Roles</h3>
                <p>
                  I led the end-to-end design process—ideating, prototyping, and building an interactive model that
                  balanced user requirements with business goals.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div class="item">
                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>
                  I created a modular, interactive dashboard featuring task metrics, team overviews, and key insights to
                  help analysts stay informed and in control. Designed as a central command surface, the dashboard aimed
                  to reduce cognitive load while making complex data immediately actionable.

            <h2>Dashboard Development</h2>
            <p>
              At the time of designing the dashboard, I didn’t have direct access to end users. Instead, I collaborated
              closely with stakeholders, internal subject-matter experts, and existing product behavior to understand
              core needs and daily workflows.
            </p>
            <p>
              I ran informal discovery sessions to define the dashboard’s role: it needed to provide a clear snapshot of
              task statuses and enable faster decisions for live investigations.
            </p>
            <p>The design approach was shaped by insights gathered from:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Established user workflows within the platform</li>
              <li>Feedback provided during client demo sessions</li>
              <li>Ongoing internal reviews with analysts and engineers</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              While this method surfaced actionable insights, the lack of structured user validation meant some
              usability issues emerged later. In hindsight, even lightweight walkthroughs or wireframe tests would have
              strengthened alignment with real-world behaviors earlier.
            </p>
            <p>
              This phase highlighted a key learning I now apply: <span class="emphasis">embedding early</span>,
              <span class="emphasis">low-effort validation loops</span> to reduce assumptions and build confidence in
              layout decisions from day one.

            <h2>1.1 - Understanding the Industry Landscape</h2>

            <p>
              To ensure the dashboard matched analyst expectations and broader UX patterns, I conducted a competitive
              review of intelligence and SaaS platforms. Common design themes included:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <span class="emphasis">High-level metrics for quick insights:</span>
                Summary stats offered fast performance reads and guided daily priorities.
              </li>

            <h2>1.2 - Understanding User Expectations</h2>
            <p>
              Following the industry and competitor review, I turned my focus to internal knowledge and client-facing
              feedback. Since the system was already embedded in investigative workflows, I needed to uncover how a new
              dashboard could reduce friction and enhance day-to-day decision-making.
            </p>
            <p>
              With no product manager in place, I conducted informal interviews with stakeholders and reviewed support
              tickets, onboarding notes, and user feedback channels. My goal was to uncover consistent patterns across
              analysts, team leads, and managers to identfy any <span class="emphasis">unmet needs</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
              One theme came through loud and clear: users didn’t want more tools. They wanted
              <span class="emphasis">clarity</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
              They needed a quick, actionable overview of their tasks, team activity, and performance signals, all in
              one place.
            </p>
            <h3>Key Findings</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span class="emphasis">Performance Visibility:</span>
                Teams lacked clarity on whether targets were being met—most insight came from ad hoc or manual reports.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="emphasis">Live Task Tracking:</span>
                Real-time context on case progress was missing, making prioritization difficult.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="emphasis">Time Awareness:</span>
                Missed meetings, unclear deadlines, and repeated effort stemmed from poor visibility into time-bound
                tasks.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="emphasis">Ownership &amp; Accountability:</span>
                Users were often unaware of task assignees, leading to confusion and duplicated work.

            <h3>User Snapshot</h3>
            <p>
              To summarise expectations across roles, I captured key frustrations and desired outcomes in a role-based

            <h2>1.3 - Affinity Mapping</h2>
            <p>
              To organize early insights from stakeholder sessions and onboarding feedback, I created a lightweight
              affinity map. This allowed key frustrations and needs to emerge organically—without slowing the project
              down with formal personas or journey maps.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rather than relying on assumptions, I clustered insights directly from real comments. This kept priorities
              focused and enabled fast, evidence-based design decisions.

            <p>
              With a clear understanding of user needs, I defined a lean strategy to translate insight into meaningful
              design outcomes. The goal wasn’t to overload users with data, it was to create a role-aware experience
              that respected context, pace, and mental load.
            </p>
            <p>Key strategic decisions included:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span class="emphasis">A modular, multi-row dashboard layout:</span> This structure aligned with
                stakeholder input, separating high-level stats, task progress, team metrics, and time-sensitive actions
                into clear zones—all within a single, glanceable interface.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="emphasis">A focused prioritisation of core features:</span> I concentrated on task
                tracking, team performance, and meeting reminders, ensuring the dashboard provided immediate value
                without overwhelming users with unnecessary functionality. <br />
                Every design decision had to pass two questions: → Does this unlock faster decision-making? → Can it
                reduce manual effort? These kept the interface purposeful and user-first.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="emphasis">Micro-interactions over navigation shifts:</span> Instead of complex navigation
                flows, I designed interactive elements that allowed users to drill down into task details or team stats
                without losing context. This kept the focus on immediate actions rather than navigating away from the
                dashboard.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This strategic baseline shaped both the low-fidelity prototypes and the final high-fidelity
              design—anchoring them in clarity, familiarity, and practical value.

            <h3>Purpose and Approach</h3>
            <p>
              With the new dashboard acting as the user’s first point of contact, early design work was essential for
              shaping its information architecture and interaction flows. These low-fidelity prototypes enabled rapid
              exploration, quick iteration, and stakeholder alignment before committing time to detailed UI decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Wireframes were built around genuine use cases gathered from onboarding feedback and internal interviews.
              I conducted informal walkthroughs with internal stakeholders to validate layout logic, feature
              prioritisation, and user expectations. This kept the focus on solving practical problems without
              over-designing at an early stage.

            <h2>1.1 - Selected Wireframes</h2>
            <p>
              Early wireframes played a pivotal role in defining the dashboard’s layout and flow. This phase enabled
              rapid iteration across core interface elements—task visibility, performance indicators, and time-sensitive
              actions—before progressing to detailed visual design.
            </p>
            <p>
              These low-fidelity explorations formed the foundation for iterative refinement, enabling feedback-driven
              improvements in clarity, structure, and user experience ahead of high-fidelity development.

                      clarity, speed, and task relevance. Wireframes focused on separating critical data zones:
                      high-level KPIs, active tasks, team activity, and upcoming deadlines. Layout rhythm and grouping
                      were designed to reduce visual noise while guiding attention to what mattered most in daily
                      operations.

                    <p>
                      Modal designs focused on surfacing key insights without disrupting user flow. These overlays
                      provided deeper context on tasks, teams, or performance metrics—allowing analysts to drill into
                      detail while staying anchored to the main dashboard view. Each modal was structured to minimise
                      cognitive load, maintain data alignment, and support quick interpretation through consistent
                      grouping, language, and visual hierarchy.

            <h2>1.2 - Data Visualisation &amp; Interface Evolution</h2>
            <p>
              As the dashboard matured, specific components—like the Task Focus table and performance graph—underwent
              strategic iterations to improve clarity, scannability, and user actionability. These refinements were not
              limited to surface polish; they shaped the system’s broader visual language and established key patterns
              that informed the design of modal tables and secondary data charts.
            </p>
            <p>
              The changes in this section laid the foundation for consistency and flexibility across the product. The
              aim was not to replicate the dashboard elements identically in every context, but to adapt them to local
              needs while keeping the overall experience intuitive and efficient.
            </p>

            <h3>Task Focus Table</h3>
            <p>
              This table began as a clean but inert record of tasks—readable, but detached from user goals around
              prioritisation and progress tracking. User expectations quickly revealed the need for a more responsive,
              action-ready interface. Iterative changes were guided by principles of scannability, hierarchy, and
              cognitive load reduction—turning the table into a decision-friendly surface. Small shifts in alignment,
              iconography, and visual encoding combined to create a tool that supports momentum, not just monitoring.

            <ul class="disc">
              <li>
                <span class="emphasis">Reordered Rows by Due Date</span>: Brought time-sensitive tasks to the top,
                allowing users to triage more effectively and honouring natural scanning rhythms.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="emphasis">Introduced a Status Column with Icon + Label</span>: Used recognisable icons with
                simple descriptors (e.g. checkmark, spinner) to make task progression immediately visible—supporting
                recognition and system status clarity.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="emphasis">Added Contextual Action Menu</span>: Integrated per-row action triggers so users
                could interact with tasks directly—boosting workflow efficiency and reducing step count.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="emphasis">Enhanced Priority Column with Icon + Label</span>: Introduced a traffic light
                icon alongside existing text (e.g. red icon next to “High”), using redundant coding to ensure urgency
                was visually and semantically conveyed. This improves accessibility and recognition.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="emphasis">Improved Column Alignment</span>: Adopted left/right anchoring for better rhythm:
                task names left-aligned for quick skimming; dates and IDs right-aligned for numeric comparison.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="emphasis">Removed Vertical Borders</span>: Cleared excess dividing lines to reduce clutter
                and improve table legibility without sacrificing structural clarity.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="emphasis">Applied Accessible Colour Contrast</span>: Ensured all icon colours and status
                indicators met WCAG guidelines, improving usability for low-vision users and maintaining clarity in
                different viewing conditions.

            <h3>Data Visualisation &amp; Interface Evolution</h3>
            <p>
              As the dashboard matured, specific components—like the Task Focus table and performance graph—underwent
              strategic iterations to improve clarity, scannability, and user actionability. These refinements were not
              limited to surface polish; they shaped the system’s broader visual language and established key patterns
              that informed the design of modal tables and secondary data charts.
            </p>
            <p>
              The changes in this section laid the foundation for consistency and flexibility across the product. The
              aim was not to replicate the dashboard elements identically in every context, but to adapt them to local
              needs while keeping the overall experience intuitive and efficient.
            </p>

            <h3>Task Focus Table</h3>
            <p>
              This table began as a clean but inert record of tasks—readable, but detached from user goals around
              prioritisation and progress tracking. User expectations quickly revealed the need for a more responsive,
              action-ready interface. Iterative changes were guided by principles of scannability, hierarchy, and
              cognitive load reduction—turning the table into a decision-friendly surface. Small shifts in alignment,
              iconography, and visual encoding combined to create a tool that supports momentum, not just monitoring.

              High-fidelity design marks the transition from conceptual exploration to polished, user-focused
              interfaces. Informed by research and guided by tangible goals, each screen was crafted in Figma™ to
              reflect user intent while supporting brand identity. The resulting layouts are responsive, accessible
              across devices, and purpose-built to enhance clarity, trust, and usability.
            </p>

            <p>
              The high-fidelity phase was not just about aesthetics; it was a deliberate, data-informed evolution of the
              earlier low-fidelity designs. Each element was carefully considered to ensure it served a clear user need,
              while also aligning with the overall design strategy established in the low-fidelity phase.

            <h2>1.1 - Final Desigsn</h2>
            <p>
              The final designs were rigorously tested for usability and accessibility, ensuring they met the diverse
              needs of analysts and stakeholders alike. This process involved iterative feedback loops, where each
              component was refined based on real-world usage scenarios and user expectations.
            </p>
            <p>
              These outcomes were grounded in earlier low-fidelity explorations, which provided a flexible foundation
              for feedback, iteration, and structural refinement this ensured the high-fidelity phase was both
              deliberate and data-informed.

                    The high-fidelity dashboard brings clarity and responsiveness to the forefront—supporting analysts
                    with a visually structured and action-ready environment. Building on earlier wireframe foundations,
                    the refined layout reinforces key content zones: high-level KPIs, active task tracking, team
                    signals, and upcoming deadlines. Visual hierarchy, alignment, and purposeful spacing were carefully
                    tuned to reduce cognitive noise while drawing focus to the most relevant interactions. The result is
                    a layout that prioritises usability without sacrificing rhythm or momentum.

            <h2>1.2 - Interaction Design &amp; Accessibility</h2>
            <p>
              Interactive behaviours were designed to feel intuitive and purposeful—providing visual feedback through
              motion, tone shifts, and spatial changes. From hover cues to pressed states, each component signals intent
              while reinforcing flow. Accessibility remained central as all elements are WCAG compliant to ensure
              inclusive usability across input types and visual abilities.

            <h2>Scaling Interaction Patterns</h2>
            <p>
              Following the same principles used in cards and buttons, data visualisations were designed with clarity,
              accessibility, and thoughtful feedback in mind. The donut chart introduced hover-based labels that
              revealed insights when relevant, keeping the interface clear and focused. This interaction model was then
              consistently applied across all charts to support easy exploration and reduce cognitive effort.

              Data visualisation is more than just presenting numbers; it’s about transforming complex datasets into
              meaningful insights that users can quickly understand and act upon. In this case study, the focus was on
              creating a dashboard that not only displayed data but also facilitated intuitive exploration and
              interpretation.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Achieving that required more than clean visuals it demanded purposeful design. Visual formats were
              selected for their fit to the task, information was structured for legibility, and established principles
              guided each decision. From layout to visual encoding, every element aimed to reduce friction and increase
              trust, helping users interpret performance at speed with confidence.

              <h2>1.1 a - Tabular Structure &amp; Readability</h2>
              <p>
                Before visualisations could guide exploration, the table needed to communicate structure and intent. Raw
                metrics were grouped meaningfully, aligned for legibility, and spaced to support fast scanning.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                UX principles such as Hick’s Law, Fitts’ Law, and proximity informed layout and interaction
                decisions—ensuring each element supported quick comparison without visual noise.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>Table Design Overview</h3>
              <p>
                The layout followed the user’s task flow: high-level identifiers on the left, granular details on the
                right. Text was left-aligned, numbers right-aligned, and spacing reinforced grouping. This structure
                laid the foundation for further refinements.
              </p>

              <h3>Table Headers</h3>
              <p>
                Original field names were rewritten for clarity and task relevance. Labels were shortened, restructured,
                and aligned to support scanning and reduce friction.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h3>Visual Indicators</h3>
              <p>
                Priority was conveyed using the traffic light system consisting of red, amber, and green paired with
                text labels for accessibility. Progress states used icons with short labels to reinforce meaning without
                relying on color alone. All indicators met WCAG contrast standards and were spaced for clarity and
                alignment.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h3>Contextual Menu</h3>
              <p>
                To reduce clutter, secondary actions were moved into a contextual menu revealed on hover or tap.
                Positioned consistently at the row’s end, it preserved spatial memory and kept the interface clean.
                Interaction states followed Material Design guidance to ensure clarity and accessibility.
              </p>

              <br />
              <h3>Design Comparison</h3>
              <p>
                The final table design reflects a series of deliberate refinements across structure, hierarchy, and
                interaction. Compared to the low-fidelity layout, the high-fidelity version improves scanability,
                reduces cognitive load, and introduces visual cues that support both speed and comprehension.

              <h2>1.2 a - Graph Design &amp; Visual Encoding</h2>
              <p>
                Three charts were used to visualise different aspects of the data. A spline chart was chosen to
                represent smooth performance trends over time, offering a more continuous and natural flow between data
                points. A line graph supported comparison of discrete metrics across time intervals. A donut chart
                highlighted proportional breakdowns within a dataset, making category contributions immediately visible.
                Each chart was refined to improve hierarchy, accessibility, and interaction clarity
              </p>
              <h3>Refined Interaction &amp; Visualisation</h3>
              <p>

              <br />
              <h3>Redundant Coding for Accessibility</h3>
              <p>
                To reduce reliance on colour alone, visual encodings were paired with shape and text. Line styles and
                point markers were differentiated to support users with colour vision deficiencies. All graphical
                elements were tested for WCAG-compliant contrast to ensure readability across backgrounds and devices.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h3>Interaction Design</h3>
              <p>
                Interactive states were refined to provide immediate feedback without introducing visual noise. Tooltips
                were simplified and positioned near the cursor, while hover and active states used subtle visual cues to
                reinforce focus. These interactions followed established design patterns to support clarity and
                responsiveness
              </p>
              <br />
              <h3>Unified Visual Language</h3>
              <p>
                The graph adopted the same visual language as the table. Colour palettes, spacing conventions, and
                interaction patterns were aligned to create a cohesive experience. This consistency reinforced user
                expectations and reduced the cognitive effort required to interpret different data views.

                    <p>
                      The spline chart was used to visualise performance trends over time. Its smooth, continuous line
                      helped reveal subtle shifts between data points, supporting pattern recognition without visual
                      harshness. A soft gradient fill was added beneath the curve to enhance visual appeal without
                      introducing additional data weight. Hover states revealed exact values at each point, allowing
                      users to explore detail without overwhelming the default view.

              This project demonstrates my ability to design complex interfaces that remain clear, consistent, and
              user-focused. Each component, from modular tables to interactive graphs, was shaped by user needs and
              refined through iterative testing. I placed strong emphasis on visual hierarchy, accessibility, and
              interaction consistency to ensure the dashboard supported fast, confident decision-making.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Throughout the process, I made deliberate design choices that balanced aesthetics with functionality.
              Small refinements, such as hover states, redundant coding, and microcopy alignment, contributed to a more
              intuitive experience. This case study reflects not only my attention to detail, but also my ability to
              think systemically and deliver solutions that scale with user complexity.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              In hindsight, earlier alignment with the quality control team could have helped anticipate testing
              constraints and reduce iteration cycles post-handoff. In future projects, I aim to stay more closely
              involved through the testing phase to better validate design decisions and close the feedback loop.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I am excited to bring this same level of care, clarity, and strategic thinking to future design
              challenges.
